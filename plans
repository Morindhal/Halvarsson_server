TODO:
Await your laurels.

DONE:
Move table, order and attribute code into the server.
Parse this information and send to a client on connection creation. (do this in a seperate function called from on_connect)
Change the click on order to move to the order tab, clear whatever was there before and display the clicked order.
Parse the information recieved on the client to create the UI.
Send a event to the server instead of directly updating the client UI.
Cache the events the server recieves and send the events to all clients, use a currentEvent integer to achieve this.
Display order events recieved if the, the event ID may or may not be used at this time. <-- ? visa upp klientens nylagda order
Look in to using some sort of QDate and the ability to send this between server/client.
Fix the QDateTime object to display a creation-current time.


HALFWAY DONE:
Fix the client UI to allow addition of new orders and attributes on specific tables. <-- not quite done but I will no longer do attributes in the first iteration
Add a connect address input and do a button-effect similar to the servers on/off buttons. <--  Only halfway done, finish this when time allows!


NOTE TO SELF:
Research changing tabs when a order object is clicked, this can also be used to create a new order is possible.  <-- Done
This may solve my current frontend UI problem.      <-- It did
