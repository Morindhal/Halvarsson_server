# Halvarsson_server
The server-side part of a restaurant order-system. (rough draft)


A qtcreator made project that holds web-socket connections from n <a href="https://github.com/Morindhal/Halvarsson_Client">client</a> connections and updates all clients based on events recieved.

This project is unfinished and unlikely to be continued.
To start the websocket listening the start server button must be pressed on the setup-tab.
